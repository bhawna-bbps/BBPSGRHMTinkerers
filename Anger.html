<h1 style="color:purple"><br>If you're wondering what anger is like, "anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured." In this list you will find pearls of wisdom like, "Anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die" and, "Anger is one letter away from danger." Anger Management is not only good for you but also has a positive impact on those closest to you. Anger is an emotion but it is a destructive emotion, like holding on to a lump of hot coal, and only a fool would keep holding it.<br>Anger is "an emotional state that varies in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury and rage," according to Charles Spielberger, PhD, a psychologist who specializes in the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied by physiological and biological changes; when you get angry, your heart rate and blood pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline.</h1>

<h1 style="color:purple"><br>Why is anger a strong emotion?<br>
When you experience physical and emotional distress, anger strongly motivates you to do something about it. As such, anger helps you cope with the stress by first discharging the tension in your body, and by doing so it calms your “nerves.” That's why you may have an angry reaction and then feel calm afterward.</h1>
<h1 style="color:purple"><br>Anger is a completely normal, usually healthy, human emotion. But when it gets out of control and turns destructive, it can lead to problems—problems at work, in your personal relationships, and in the overall quality of your life. And it can make you feel as though you're at the mercy of an unpredictable and powerful emotion. This brochure is meant to help you understand and control anger.<br><br><h1>
